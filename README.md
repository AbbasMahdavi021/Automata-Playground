# Automata-Playground

This repository contains a collection of automata implemented using JFLAP, 
a powerful software tool for experimenting with formal languages and automata. 
The automata models included in this repository cover various types, such as finite automata (FA), pushdown automata (PDA), and Turing machines (TM).

The purpose of this repository is to provide a playground for exploring and understanding the behavior of different automata models. 
Each automaton is accompanied by a JFLAP file (.jff) that can be opened and simulated using the JFLAP software.
